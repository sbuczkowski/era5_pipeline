* Copernicus and CDSAPI
To access the ECMWF Copernicus data store and retrieve data, one must
be registered with the Copernicus Climate Data Store (cds) and have a
personal key (which one stores in ~/.csdapirc) and a valid install of
the cdsapi. Details can be found at the following link:

https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/how-to-api


* cdsapirc
Needed to authenticate with ECMWF CDS data servers to allow
download. This is a dot-file in my your home directory
(~/.cdsapirc). Key is specific to a CDS account.


~/.cdsapirc looks like the following:
url: https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/api
key: 51538337-bd6a-45fc-bfb4-11d048e9da27

Your CDSAPI key is found in your login profile on the CDS website. Go
there, log in and then click on your name in the top right
corner. THen click "Your profile". Scroll down to "API Token".


* CDSAPI
CDS provides a python API for automating download of dataset
collections. Unfortunately, it's documentation is non-existant as of
this writing.

One must have the CDSAPI installed in their local environment where
their python3 installation can see it. (see instructions at the link above)

An example of a python script to grab a couple variables for one day is below:

#!/usr/bin/env python

import cdsapi

cds = cdsapi.Client()

cds.retrieve('reanalysis-era5-pressure-levels', {
    "variable": "t/q/o3",
    "pressure_level": "all",
    "product_type": "reanalysis",
    "date": "2017-12-01",
    "time": "all",
    "format": "netcdf"
}, 'download_test.nc')

* ERA5_monthly
Queries are defined for ERA5 monthly data pulls in ERAQueries.py. If
you want to add variables, they have to be put in those queries once
you find the variable names in the CDS documentation.

To use the current crop of queries, build a text driver file for the
years and months you want to download. e.g. to download 2024 Aug and
Sept:

2024 08
2024 09

Then run the shell script ERA5_get_monthly_avg.sh like so:

./ERA5_get_monthly_avg.sh era5.driver

This scripts builds the required queries and submits them to the
CDS. Data comes back as netcdf (defined in the query) in the directory
/asl/models/era5_monthly/INCOMING as files named
YYYY-MM_{lev,sfc}.nc. These files then need to be moved into the
appropriate /asl/models/era5_monthly/YYYY directories

* Notes
  - CDS downloads are a pain. 
  - ERA5_monthly is the least painful
  - ERA5-interim is unwieldy, at best. It is slow and requires a LOT
    of data packing games to optimizeretrieval and download
    times. Those times are SLOW and the dataset is HUGE.
