Needed to authenticate with ECMWF CDS data servers to allow
download. Must be a dot-file in my home directory. Key is specific to
my CDS account but can be used without having access to my account.

* Download script
CDS provides a python API for automating download of dataset
collections. Unfortunately, it's documentation is non-existant.

As of this writing, it appears that the variables we normally pull
down in ERA-Interim and ECMWF can be found in the datasets
reanalysis-era5-pressure-levels and reanalysis-era5-single-levels

#+NAME: getera5
#+BEGIN_SRC python :exports code :tangle ~/prgdir/src/python/getera5.py
#!/usr/bin/env python

import cdsapi

cds = cdsapi.Client()

cds.retrieve('reanalysis-era5-pressure-levels', {
    "variable": "t/q/o3",
    "pressure_level": "all",
    "product_type": "reanalysis",
    "date": "2017-12-01",
    "time": "all",
    "format": "netcdf"
}, '/home/sbuczko1/Work/download_test.nc')

* Notes
- CDS downloads are a pain.
